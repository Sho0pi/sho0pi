I'm from Israel 🇮🇱, currently in the East Asia Time zone 🌏. Huge fan of Golang, Kotlin, Android, functional programming, open-source, and writing code that will make our life easier 💻. When I'm not crushing bugs or building dreams, you can find me painting 🎨, swimming 🏊, or backpacking around the world (I've been solo traveling for over a year 🗺️).
